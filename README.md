## 📍 Problem Statement
Vehicles have a variety of dashboard warning lights, such as the engine management light or the oil pressure warning light, that are intended to draw your attention if anything isn't quite right.<br>
During a journey if one or more of them stay on or turn on, it may indicate that the car needs to have a problem fixed.<br>
It takes professional or experience expertise to diagnose the faults which eventually results to causing traffic issues, more damage or time wasting affecting the owner and people around. <br><br><br>

## 📍 Objective 
The aim of this project is to build a bot app that uses AI (Computer Vision and NLP) to diagnose car faults from chats and pictures of the emergency lights.<br>
The user chats with the bot about issues relating to car faults and emergrncy light and also sends picture of the light for the bot to diagnose and provide possible solution.<br><br><br>


## 📍 Data
The image dataset contains several images of emergency lights from various car dashboards in seperate labelled folders and samequantity. It was curated manually, augmented, preprocessed and trained.
The intents corpus for the NLP was also curated manually and contains possible questions with their respective answer for the bot to learn.<br><br><br>


## 📍 Skills and Technologies

* Programming (Python, JavaScript)
* Data wrangling (Pandas, Numpy)
* Data Analysis and Visualization. (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Machine/ Deep learning (Tensorflow, Scikit Learn)
* Computer Vision (CNN, MLP, Open CV, Transfer Learning)
* Natural Language Processing (RNN, LSTM)
* Backend (Flask, Ajax.js)
* Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
* Cloud deployment (Railway, Heroku)

## 📍 Notebook
#### This Jupyter notebook containing some exploratory analysis, model training and evaluation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Ajisco/CarBot/blob/master/CV%20Model.ipynb/) <br><br><br>

## 📍 App FEATURES 
1. Virtual assistant in form of a bot that chats with user, available 24/7.
2. The bot accepts pictures as input, Camera available in mobile version.
3. Web app compatible with every device. <br><br><br>




## 📍 DEPLOYMENT 🚀

#### This app is deployed at [Railway](https://render.com)
	
#### You can access it [Here](https://carbot.onrender.com) <br><br><br>


## 📍 App use and testing
The images to test the bot can be found [Here](https://bit.ly/carbot-test-images) <br><br><br>


## 📍 Limitations
1. The chatbot only answers limited questions (focused on some car faults/ issues)
2. The app does not exclude images that are not related to the problem.
3. few solutions provided for now. 
4. The app is bringing errors because  the free deployment service does not have enough memory to run the app.<br><br><br>

## 📍 To improve
1. I would love to build a seperate binary classification computer vision model that helps exclude images that are not emergency lights.
2. I would love to integrates some sites or APIs that help to solve car faults or connect to nearby mechanic workshops.
3. I would love to improve the corpus for the chatbot intents and scrape lots of reliable vehicle aid websites to increase the functionality of the bot. 
4. I ould love top deploy the app using a paid cloud srvice with large memory enough run the app and host the dependencies.<br><br><br>
